### Keynotes
- Automated tests should be human-readable and treated as same as the production code. They are repeatable and auditable.
- **Dependency iceberg** says that our code is just a tip of all the code the application runs on. The dependencies are below.
  - Most of the code are dependencies, feature and performance enhancements (Spring libraries, JSON/XML mappers, ORM implementation, servlets, etc.), and security patches.
  - We cannot rely 100% on it, especially if we use the last stable versions. On the other hand, old versions have security flaws (Struts).
- How many automated tests should I write? Whatever gives me the confidence to deploy PROD without manual intervention (i.e. code coverage is just informative).
- Manual testing is still needed but it is exploratory testing.

### Rating ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆
- ✅ Very catchy speech, theoretical aspects and importance of testing, best-practices of unit testing
- ⛔ Too short (not the speaker's fault), code examples weren't that impressive, no mention about [BDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development) approach
