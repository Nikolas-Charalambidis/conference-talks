## [How To Be a Java Automated Testing Superstar](https://springone.io/2021/sessions/how-to-be-a-java-automated-testing-superstar)
- Length 26:24, watched on 2021-09-07, **#architecture #testing**
- Billy Korando as Java Developer Advocate, Oracle
- Track: Architecture

### Keynotes
- Automated tests should be human-readable and treated as same as the production code. They are repeatable and auditable.
- **Dependency iceberg** says that our code is just a tip of all the code the application runs on. The dependencies are below.
  - Most of the code are dependencies, feature and performance enhancements (Spring libraries, JSON/XML mappers, ORM implementation, servlets, etc.), and security patches.
  - We cannot rely 100% on it, especially if we use the last stable versions. On the other hand, old versions have security flaws (Struts).
- How many automated tests should I write? Whatever gives me the confidence to deploy PROD without manual intervention (i.e. code coverage is just informative).
- Manual testing is still needed but it is exploratory testing.

### Rating ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆
- ✅ Theoretical aspects and importance of testing, best-practices of unit testing.
- ⛔ Too short (not the speaker's fault), code examples weren't that impressive, no mention about [BDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development) approach.

## [Deploy Code into Production Faster on Kubernetes](https://springone.io/2021/sessions/modern-application-configuration-in-kubernetes)
- Length 27:31, watched on 2021-09-07, **#devops #kubernetes #cloud #native**
- Valentina Alaria as Director Product Management, VMware
- Track: Cloud Native Platforms

### Keynotes
- Most of Kubernetes offerings are delivered as a bag of parts:
  - 63 % of organizations, if use K8S, use as internal platforms or build internal platforms.
  - 94 % of organizations, if use K8S, building internal platforms use more than one platform.
  - 58 % of organizations agree that architectural decision making has gotten harder.
- Developer experience on DIY platforms is lacking. Developers must still maintain containers, configure containers run through multiple layers of YAML, manage IT and security aspects.
- Importance lies in tooling to help developers: leverage automatized DevOps practices, enforce organizational best-practices, app-aware platform, preconfigured templates by Ops.

### Rating ⭐⭐☆☆☆
- ✅ Beginner-friendly introduction, on-spot developer concerns identification.
- ⛔ The structure doesn't match the agenda in the introduction and a bit chaotic, rather Tanzu platform promotion, lacking expected pure K8S tips.

## [Modern Application Configuration in Kubernetes](https://springone.io/2021/sessions/modern-application-configuration-in-kubernetes)
- Length 26:49, watched on 2021-09-07, **#devops #kubernetes #spring #cloud**
- Craig Walls as Engineer, VMware
- Track: Architecture

### Keynotes
- Spring applications environment configuration is based on Spring Environment Abstraction as of Spring 3.1 (`application.properties`, `application.yml`, command-args, JVM system properties...). 
- They can be in the filesystem and are very difficult to audit and manage across multiple applications and instances. Solution:
  - Spring Environment Abstraction is extensible and has a solution for versioned (Git, Vault, DB, CredHub...), audited (git log) and centralized configuration - Spring Cloud Config Server
  - Such configuration must be read from the server and merged into Environment - Spring Cloud Config Server client library
- Although Spring Config Server/Client can run on K8S, it must be merged into Resources, that are K8S native, like config-maps and secrets - Tenzu
- **Spring Cloud Config:** Central management of properties, can be versioned, can be audited, HTTP-based property consumption, probably should be secured, requires client-size library or code
- **K8S Config-maps and secrets:** Doesn't require special client code, K8S-native, not centrally managed, versioning/auditing is not built-in, can leverage K8S-native security
 
### Rating ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- ✅ Very catchy speech, an excellent introduction into the environment properties management problem and comparison of approaches
- ⛔ The speaker has only one session

## [You Can Be Cloud Native, Too](https://springone.io/2021/sessions/you-can-be-cloud-native-too)
- Length 27:00, watched on 2021-09-07, **#cloud #native**
- Hananiel Sarella as Software Engineer, VMware
- Track: Beginner-Friendly Spring

### Keynotes
- Microservice architecture provides easy to maintain, test, and deploy services, teams can be scaled, polyglot-friendly, distribute systems are rather complex and interaction is difficult to test, memory consumption and overhead
- Cloud-native patterns: Consistent management, run everywhere, secure, seamlessly adopt new environments, distributed systems patterns and abstractions
- Steeltoe Project introduction on top of .NET foundation enables building production-grade and cloud-native microsystems in a simplified way quick to stand up
  - Scalability (service discovery, configuration providers), Resilience (circuit breaker, bulkhead, client-side load balancing), Ease of Use (initializer, autoconfiguration, platform providers and connectors such as DB, MQ, OAuth), Observability (management endpoints, dynamic logging, distributed tracing, metrics), Security (SSO, JWT auth, certificates), Messaging (stream processing)

### Rating ⭐⭐⭐☆☆
- ✅ Broad overview of microservice architecture facilities and difficulties
- ⛔ Missing introduction into cloud-native concepts since this is marked as beginner-friendly, .NET examples
