# conference-talks

This repository contains my *personal* notes from the attended conferences and watched tech talks. I tried to capture the content of the lectures as closely as possible without completing or intervening in the notes. In this way, I also would like to scrap responsibility for misleading information, errors, or inaccuracies, though typos can happen. At the same time, be mindful that English is not my native language, which might make the resulting notes appear clumsy.

All sessions related to a single conference or tech talks event are in a single markdown file for more straightforward navigation and are in the chronological order I have attended.

I don't include my rating to avoid pre-justice and bias because I am convinced that each session was worth attending and that our tastes, interests, and experience differ. (Also, until now, I haven't bumped into a session during which I had the urge to leave.)

I have to state that I am not an owner or author of the freely publicized videos and the content of all the online and on-site attended sessions. I always credit the presenter. I double-checked that posting my *personal* notes online is aligned with the relevant code of conduct of the conference or tech talk event, supposing there is any.
