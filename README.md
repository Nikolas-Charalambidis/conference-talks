# conference-talks

This repository contains my *personal* notes from the attended conferences and watched tech talks. I tried to capture the content of the lectures as closely as possible without completing or intervening in the notes. In this way, I also would like to scrap responsibility for misleading information, errors, or inaccuracies, though typos can happen. At the same time, be mindful that English is not my native language, which might make the resulting notes appear clumsy.

All sessions related to a single conference or tech talks event are in a single Markdown file for ease of navigation and listed in the chronological order in which I attended them.

I refrain from disclosing my rating in the contents at the beginning of each file to avoid bias and prejudice, as I believe that each session was worth attending and that our tastes, interests, and experiences differ. (Also, I have yet to experience a session where I felt the urge to leave.)

I must point out that I am not the owner or author of the freely published videos and content of all sessions I attended online and on-site. I always credit the presenter. I double-checked that the online publication of my *personal* notes complies with the conference or tech talk event code of conduct, if any.
